## Project Overview
Retail vegetable prices can vary significantly due to a variety of factors. Here are some aspects that can contribute to these differences:
- Supply Chain and Transportation Costs: The cost to transport vegetables to different areas can influence prices. Remote or less accessible areas might have higher prices due to higher transportation costs.
- Demand: In areas with higher demand for certain vegetables, prices may be higher due to the principles of supply and demand.

The volatility of vegetable prices poses a significant challenge for stakeholders across the agricultural supply chain, including farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. To ensure effective market operations and informed decision-making, it is essential to:
- Assess the extent of price stability for individual vegetables, identifying patterns and trends over time.
- Detect and analyse anomalies, such as sudden price spikes or drops, that could disrupt supply, demand, or profitability.

## Data dictionary
This is the vegetable prices dataset that was collected over a period of a year from the 1st of January 2023 to 1st of January 2024. The dataset appears to have been collected on random dates on a monthly basis.

- **Price Dates:** The dates when the price data was collected

- **Bhindi (Ladies finger) :** The price at which Bhindi (Ladies finger) is sold 

- **Tomato:** The price at which Tomato is sold 

- **Onion:** The price at which Onion is sold 

- **Potato:** The price at which Potato is sold 

- **Brinjal:** The price at which Brinjal is sold 

- **Garlic:** The price at which Garlic is sold 

- **Peas:** The price at which Peas is sold 

- **Methi:** The price at which Methi is sold 

- **Green Chilli:** The price at which Chilli is sold  

- **Elephant Yam (Suran):** The price at which Elephant Yam (Suran) is sold

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved calculating descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and range to understand the central tendency and variability of various features related to vegetable prices.

## Conclusion And Insight
- Vegetables like Bhindi (Ladies finger), Brinjal and Onion show seasonal fluctuations, peaking and dipping at different times,

- Tomato maintains a constant price of 16 throughout the year, indicating possible stable demand and production.

- Garlic shows a consistent price increase during the year, reflecting a possible increase in demand or a decline production during the year.

- Several vegetables, like Peas, Green Chilli and Elephant Yam (Suran) peak in July, August and October, indicating possible harvest cycles or seasonal popularity.

- Vegetables like Bhindi (Ladies finger), Brinjal and Garlic shows price peaks in December, hinting at a higher demand.

- The price of Brinjal and Garlic, Onions, and Bhindi show an increase in the winter season, this may be due to the demand during the winter season and the supply not being sufficient in the season.

- The price of peas has been inconsistent with a 123.85 being the highest price and that shows a possibility of demand in the peas for a certain season or festivity durng the month of October. That being the beginning of the winter season.

- Potatoes also have shown some flactuations in the year with a slight drop in Feb â€“ April, which could possibly indicate that they have sufficient supply during the preiod. 

- On the Methi the graph is skewed to the right because of larger value which is the 2000 price and pulls the mean to the right.

- On the Green Chilli the graph is skewed to the left because of a smaller value which is the 0.13 price and pulls the mean to the left.

Correlation:

- Garlic has a strong positive correlation with Onion (0.76), suggesting their trends are closely aligned. The relationship could be influenced by growth conditions and market demand.

- Bhindi (Ladies finger) and Brinjal share a positive correlation of 0.53, suggesting their trends are somewhat aligned. Their connection may stem from comparable growing conditions. Bhindi and Brinjal might often be sold together, especially if they are staples in local cuisine.
